# Azure Event Hubs data source discovery

When running a discovery against an Azure Event Hub namespace defined within your [Data source configuration](xref:PIAdapterForAzureEventHubsDataSourceConfiguration), you can specify query parameters to narrow the scope of the discovery, targeting specific event hubs within the namespace. When the discovery completes, you can add the discovered items to your data selection configuration.

## Azure Event Hubs query string

Azure Event Hubs `query` strings must include one or more `EventHubName`, along with a `WaitTime` that specifies how long the discovery runs.

```text
EventHubNames=<EVENT_HUB_1>,<EVENT_HUB_2>;WaitTime=<DAYS>.<HOURS>:<MINUTES>:<SECONDS>
```

Within the discovery request JSON payload, enter the Azure Event Hubs query using the `query` parameter, as shown in the [query examples](#query-examples) below. For more information on using the query parameter during API requests to the `api/v1/configuration/<componentId>/discoveries` endpoint, see <xref:DiscoveryConfiguration>.

## Query parameters

When including a `query` within your discovery, you can add parameters from the table that follows. Separate the `EventHubNames` and `WaitTime` parameters with a semicolon (`;`).

String item | Required | Description
--|--|--
`EventHubNames` | Required | Specifies one or more event hub as query targets during discovery. Discovery looks for the specified event hubs within the namespace set in the [Data source configuration](xref:PIAdapterForAzureEventHubsDataSourceConfiguration) using the `EventHubNamespaceConnectionString` parameter.<br><br>&bull; When querying for more than one event hub, seperate each event hub with a comma (`,`).<br>&bull; The maximum number of event hubs that you can query is **ten**, as Microsoft Azure limits each namespace to ten event hubs.
`WaitTime` | Optional | Specifies the duration of the discovery. If you omit the `WaitTime` parameter, discovery defaults to one minute: `0.00:01:00`.<br><br>&bull; **Minimum value:** 30 seconds (`0.00:00:30`)<br>&bull; **Maximum value:** 7 days (`7.00:00:00`). This maximum is limited by Azure Event Hubs, as it retains messages for seven days.<br><br>**Note:** Discoveries with `WaitTimes` outside of the minimum and maximum values are considered invalid and fail with the following message:<br><br>`Discovery operation failed: Exception type: ArgumentException. Message: Wait Time must be between 30 seconds and 7 days`. 

## Query examples

The following section contains several examples of Azure Event Hub queries. When creating a discovery request, include the Azure Event Hub query within the request payload as shown in [Configure discovery](xref:DiscoveryConfiguration#configure-discovery).

### Example 1: Single event hub

This Azure Event Hubs query example discovers a single event hub.

```json
{
    "query": "EventHubNames=event-hub-1;WaitTime=0.00:00:30"
}
```

### Example 2: Multiple event hubs

This Azure Event Hubs query example discovers multiple event hubs.

```json
{
    "query": "EventHubNames=event-hub-1,event-hub-2;WaitTime=0.00:00:30"
}
```

### Example 3: No WaitTime

This Azure Event Hubs query example discovers multiple event hubs, but omits the `WaitTime` parameter. Without a specified `WaitTime`, the discovery defaults to a `WaitTime` of one minute.

```json
{
    "query": "EventHubNames=event-hub-1,event-hub-2"
}
```

## Query results

After you submit a discovery request and the discovery completes, you can view its results and use them to create a [Data selection configuration](xref:PIAdapterForAzureEventHubsDataSelectionConfiguration). To view results for your discovery and query, perform a `GET` request against the `api/v1/configuration/componentId/discoveries/<discoveryId>/result` endpoint. For more information, see [REST URLs](xref:DiscoveryConfiguration#rest-urls).

The discovery results includes a data selection configuration for each stream it finds for an event hub. For example, the following discovery results include a configuration for two streams found for `"eventHubName":"event-hub-1"`: `"streamId": "event-hub-1.$.PumpTemperature"` and `"streamId": "event-hub-1.$.TimeStamp"`.

```json
[
    {​​​
        "eventHubName": "event-hub-1",
        "deviceId": null,
        "valueField": "$.PumpTemperature",
        "IndexField": null,
        "IndexFormat": null,
        "dataType": "Single",
        "selected": false,
        "name": null,
        "streamId": "event-hub-1.$.PumpTemperature",
        "dataFilterId": null
    }​​​,
    {​​​
        "eventHubName": "event-hub-1",
        "deviceId": null,
        "valueField": "$.TimeStamp",
        "IndexField": null,
        "IndexFormat": null,
        "dataType": "DateTime",
        "selected": false,
        "name": null,
        "streamId": "event-hub-1.$.TimeStamp",
        "dataFilterId": null
    }​​​
]
```

### `StreamId` special character replacement

In query results for `streamId`, the text parser replaces any automatically generated special characters with a replacement character to make identifiers more meaningful. You can manually override these replacement characters by manually editing the data selection configuration. 

* For more information on character replacement, see [Special characters support](xref:TextParser#special-characters-support). 
* For more information on overriding replacement characters within a `streamId`, see <xref:PIAdapterForAzureEventHubsDataSelectionConfiguration>.

### Combining query results into a valid data selection configuration 

After viewing the results of a discovery, you can manually combine them into a single valid data selection configuration. In the example below, the two data selection configurations from the example above are combined into single configuration. Notice that `IndexField` is updated to `$.TimeStamp`.

After creating a valid data selection configuration, you can activate it by performing a `PUT` request against the `api/v1/configuration/<ComponentId>/DataSelection` endpoint. For more information, see <xref:PIAdapterForAzureEventHubsDataSelectionConfiguration>.

```json
[
    {
        "eventHubName": "event-hub-1",
        "deviceId": null,
        "valueField": "$.PumpTemperature",
        "IndexField": "$.TimeStamp",
        "IndexFormat": null,
        "dataType": "Single",
        "selected": true,
        "name": null,
        "streamId": "event-hub-1.$.PumpTemperature",
        "dataFilterId": null
    }
]
```

### Additional considerations for `query` and `autoselect`

When you use the `query` parameter within a discovery request, OSIsoft recommends setting the [autoSelect](xref:DiscoveryConfiguration#discovery-parameters) parameter to `false` for most use cases. 

OSIsoft makes this recommendation because the configuration is not suitable for a production environment without manually editing its settings <!--, most notably the `IndexField` setting-->, when the configuration is generated automatically, the index field will not be configured in the active [Data selection configuration](xref:PIAdapterForAzureEventHubsDataSelectionConfiguration) and the adapter will default to recording the time that the adapter received the message as opposed to when the data was collected. 

OSIsoft makes this recommendation because the data selection configuration that discovery returns includes only values and not indexes. Therefore, `"autoSelect": true` should only be used for data sources with simple data structures, as it automatically applies the discovery results as the active [Data selection configuration](xref:PIAdapterForAzureEventHubsDataSelectionConfiguration).
